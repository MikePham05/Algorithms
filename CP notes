DP classing problems LEARNING:
    WHEN:
        - Finding MIN MAX value
        - Counting Total

    Classical Problem
    - coin counts
    - longest subseq O(n log n):
        dp + binary search 
       idea: at ith position, binary search for the maximum value that dp[i] can update from in range(0,  i)
    - Min, max path down right for grid


Range query:
    - Min, Max Query: pre-calculate all Min, Max value for ranges with length in power of 2 for the array
    - Sum: Prefix Sum
    -
